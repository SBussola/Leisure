        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Leisure is an electronic pop band from Auckland, New Zealand, formed in 2015. The band is known for blending elements of funk, R&B, and downtempo music to create a smooth and laid-back sound that evokes a relaxed, vacation-like atmosphere. Their music features gentle melodies and polished production that invites listeners to unwind and enjoy.
            Their latest album, Leisurevision, explores more personal and introspective themes, reflecting changes in the band members' lives, such as becoming parents. Leisure is also recognized for their engaging live performances and has steadily gained an international following, touring across the U.S. and other regions.</p>
